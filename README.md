Dark Knight Arena is an fps game i made using Unity,C# and Python.
The are various game modes,for example we have the story/campaign mode,with an interesting story,cutscenes and dialogues.Another game mode is the Online Multiplayer Mode: destroy everyone and dominate the entire game! You can also customize your guns with cool customizations and colors.

To download the game,you must have Windows 8,Windows 8.1,Windows 10 or Windows 11.

Download everything as a zip file,and run Dark Knight Arena.exe,that will be the game launcher. Sometimes may happen that the anti virus blocks it from running,if the game doesn't work that's the reason,try to disable it and run the game again. For any questions or support,contact me on discord!
